                        <h2>1. Why do you become a Designer?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe that being able to live a life of service to others is an enormous privilege. I focus on enhancing other people, share knowledge and build on each other – which always in a case of a friendships relationships. I only use as many resources as necessary to keep the design simple and accessible.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>2. What is your design philosophy?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I have no philosophy and not interested in awards or design trends, but form follows function. I listen, I understand, and then I design with other people. The idea comes first, then prototype, and then further improvement based on what I have learned with other people — as simple as that.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>3. Who have you helped in the past?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe that no one is too small to make a difference. I assist people ranging from solopreneurs to in-house product teams, from start-ups to tech companies. If you had an open-minded and can identify a problem, I do my best to find you a design solution (with you).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>4. What motivates you at work?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I don’t need motivation. Motivation is emotional and not reliable. As a professional designer, I don’t have many privileges to wait for it. Discipline and a daily habit that doesn’t rely on motivation work much better for me. Discipline only forces me to start, and the continuing will be so much easier.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>5. Have you done a project like mine before?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Chances are if I recently have done a similar project in the past few months — I probably won’t take your project as a courtesy to my client and professional advancements. Due to the rapid change in digital product, the past’s innovative solutions may not be relevant in today’s context. I often find myself exploring unrealistic yet intriguing ideas rather than repeat the same process over and over.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>6. Where do you draw inspiration from?</h2>
                        <p>
                            To be specific, I’m not sure. I often find myself excited with a real-world problem from other people, the freeform shape of nature and its harmony, and the magical communication of music.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>7. How do you acquire new knowledge?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I’m imagining, learning, and thinking by doing.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>8. Any portfolio publication terms?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Just like other creatives and designer, I display the deliverables as a recognition of creative excellence and professional advancement (portfolio).In general, after I deliver the project, I will delay my portfolio up to 90 days — or as soon as the project goes public. I DO NOT work as a white-label.
